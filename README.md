## Problem Statement

Farmers often lack access to real-time market intelligence and direct market access, which leads to dependency on intermediaries, delayed price information, and reduced profit margins. Market prices for agricultural produce vary frequently across regions and marketplaces, but farmers typically rely on outdated or informal sources to make selling decisions. This information gap prevents them from choosing the right market, timing their sales effectively, and negotiating fair prices.

Additionally, the absence of a unified digital platform limits farmers’ ability to connect directly with buyers, forcing them to depend on middlemen who control pricing and market access. This results in income instability, limited transparency, and reduced financial empowerment for farmers. Addressing these challenges requires a system that provides real-time market data, transparent price discovery, and direct access to markets, enabling farmers to make informed decisions and improve their economic outcomes.

## Proposed Solution

KisanSetu is a web-based platform designed to provide farmers with real-time market intelligence and direct access to buyers through a single unified system. The platform displays updated crop prices across nearby markets, shows short-term price trends, and highlights buyer demand to help farmers decide the right time and place to sell their produce.

In addition to market insights, KisanSetu enables direct farmer-to-buyer interaction. Farmers can list their crops, receive price offers from buyers, and accept the most profitable deal without relying on intermediaries. The system also provides simple, explainable recommendations such as *Sell Now*, *Hold*, or *High Demand*, based on recent price trends and buyer activity, supporting transparent and informed decision-making.

## Innovation & Creativity

KisanSetu stands out by focusing on action-based market intelligence rather than just displaying raw price data. The platform not only informs farmers about market conditions but also guides them on what action to take next using explainable logic.

Key innovative aspects include:
- Decision-oriented recommendations instead of static price listings  
- Direct digital bridge between farmers and buyers  
- Transparent and explainable insights rather than black-box predictions  
- Farmer-first design focused on simplicity and trust  

This approach transforms KisanSetu into a decision-support and empowerment platform for farmers.
